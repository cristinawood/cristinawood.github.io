## Code

Last week's exercises and readings on code were challenging to say the least, if not as a result of a new subject to this history student, then by the sheer volume of information and graphics to take in. However, it was great to learn about and get a sense of the possibilities in digital humanities for those who know or are willing to learn and understand the basics of code. Lauren Klein's summary of digital pedagocial tools in the humanities were particularly exciting for me. In seeing so succinctly the "artifact type," creator(s), URL, ****and**** sometimes, student responses, I was inspired at how accessible and helpful such digital tools can be. Benjamin Schmidt's examination of algorithms in the digital humanities also convinced me of the accessibility of such tools. Using examples in the field of history, he writes, that digital humanists need not be the creators of complicated algorithms, but should aim to be "creative users of new ideas, rather than users of tools the purposes of which we decline to know." 

I'm looking forward to becoming more comfortable with these ideas, and embracing the new!
