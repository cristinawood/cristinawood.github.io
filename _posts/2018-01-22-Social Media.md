I'm behind in my reading and annotations this week after an extended sickness. Was glad to sink my teeth into these fascinating ideas today, especially after recently having joined Twitter and feeling like a more active participant in the social media we're engaging with. 

I began with Spangler et al.'s collection of reflections on the role of scholars as accountable to activist groups and movements. I was really struck by the connections with my field of public history in terms of the discussion of hierarchy vs. an egalitarian interaction. It's so tempting for public historians (particularly those employed in the academic setting) to want or feel they need to preserve a sense of authority as researchers and experts, and in doing so, risk appropriating the stories of underrepresented people and communities. Stephen High writes on *Sharing Authority* in doing oral histories, and I've found his thoughts really valuable. Of course, these themes are complicated with social media's pitfalls (bots, sockpuppets, algorithms) but the platforms remain invaluable tools for scholars to connect with and listen to the groups they're accountable to. 

I was super excited by the *Documenting the Now* and *Tracking Russian Influence Operations on Twitter* pieces as open-access (on Github!) examples of DH at work. I'm finding more and more that I'm spotting the themes we've studied quickly (text analysis techniques and data mining for example) and these examples are reinforcing their importance for me. Looking at Treeverse immediately brought to mind our studies of data visualization - such a great tool. 

Kris Shaffer's work on fighting internet propaganda, the botnet, and reflecting on Twitter politics and divisions have been enlightening and frightening to read. I found myself making connections to Laurie Griess' response [*Social Media, Digital Humanities and Community Activism*] (http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/question/what-relationship-does-digital-humanitiesacademy-have-social-media-activist-movements) and her thoughts on taking care of ourselves as researchers. I was also thinking of [this piece from Harvard on digital literacy in schools] (https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/18/01/digital-literacy-digital-natives#.WmSzUeGeUeA.twitter) that I came across on Twitter. 

More on this later, looking forward to class.
