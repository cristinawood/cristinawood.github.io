I loved exploring the tangible applications of mapping this week, and my readings were definitely affected by the fact that I was thinking about how to present the ideas to our class. The spatial turn, space and place were big ideas I wanted to explore in class. 
I thought we could trace humanistic's geography's evolution from space as location, distance, to place as lived and experienced. This starts with Yi-Fu Tuan: 

What we cannot say in an acceptable scientific language
we tend to deny or forget.  A geographer speaks as though
his knowledge of space and place were derived exclusively
from books, maps, aerial photographs, and
structured field surveys. He writes as though people were
endowed with mind and vision but no other sense with
which to apprehend the world and find meaning in it. He
and the architect-planner tend to assume familiarity –
the fact that we are oriented in space and home in place
– rather than describe and try to understand what
‘‘being-in-the-world’’ is truly like. 

- Yi-Fu Tuan, 1977

Tim Cresswell on Place: 
- “conception of place describes a way of relating to the world” (Cresswell 4)
- There is a “distinction between an abstract realm of space and an experienced and felt world of place” (Cresswell 4)
Place is marked by experience, dwelling (Heideggerian dasein) but recent human geography considers “placelessness and nonplace.” 
- These are “marked by a lack of attachment, by constant circulation, communication and consumption” (Cresswell 5)
More on this later!

Below I've pasted my version (heavily adapted from Shawn's) of a tutorial to georectify and input a historical map into Palladio:

Mapping The “Construction U” Exhibit
1.	finding our Historical map 
Start by finding the following page on Carleton’s Archives & Research Collection website: 
https://arc.library.carleton.ca/exhibits/construction-u
Poke around there, and find the image titled “Master Plan for Carleton College” under the heading “Discipline of Nature.” Save that image file to your computer, we’ll need it soon.
2.	georectifying
We’re going to georectify the image we just saved, manipulating it to match a geographic projection, like the one on Google Maps. Open up http://mapwarper.net and login with your Github information. 
Next, click the “Upload Map” tab, and fill in a title, and the optional source credit “Carleton University Library Historical Photographs,” and upload the image.
You should now see the historical map on the left, and an OpenStreetMap on the right. Find Ottawa and Carleton on the OpenStreetMap.  
Now you’ll have to match three points of reference called control points on both maps. Drop the pins in place and click “Add Control Points” until you have 3 control points on the map. 
Click “Warp Image.” Congratulations, you’ve georectified a map! 
3.	using the map in Palladio
Make sure to click the “Export” tab to get a copy of your georectified image for the next step. Copy and save the “Tiles based” link to your map. It should look like http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/26400/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
Open up Palladio http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio-app/#/upload in a new tab and input the following data: 

Place	Coordinates
MacOdrum Library		45.3818585, -75.6994731
Tory Building	45.3826096, -75.6981681
Paterson Hall	45.3820294, -75.6987039
Click over to the Map tab once you’ve input this data. Hit “New Layer” and then hit “Tiles,” and paste your URL from earlier into the form. Click “Add Layer.” You should see your map on the land. From here, we could add points, stories, images from the “Construction U” exhibit.
