While every week prompts lots of thought and many questions, the readings on Public Humanities have really felt like we've only scratched the surface in terms of the complexities of putting your work out there. Especially in institutional contexts with traditional (analog) ways of operating, expecting emerging scholars to engage with their research publics, or general publics, without an understanding of what that entails can be so tricky. As I read Colleen Morgan and Judith Winters' "Intro to Critical Blogging in Archaeology, I was thinking that even having institutional higher-ups become aware of the downsides and opening up a discussion about how these might be mitigated would be so helpful in preventing researchers with an online presence from becoming isolated and at risk.

I loved Tressie McMillan Cottom's essay on Microcelebrity and Digital Sociology, and the different ways in which she is able to operate as a scholar online. I was struck with how her work in digital sociology resists trolls and turns the negative experiences into quantifiable research results.
