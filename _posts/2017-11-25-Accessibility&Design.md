I was struck this week by a broader discussion about "problem-solving" and the sense that while the aim of accessibility is not always easy to meet for everyone's needs, it's **so** worth striving for! 

In Eleanor Ratliff's "Accessibility Whack-A-Mole," I really liked the approach of a "lens of inclusivity" as Wellcome worked through a rebranding process. She writes:

"Design is not a dark art; it’s a series of decisions. Sharing early and often brings the benefit of feedback and allows us to see work from different perspectives. It also offers the opportunity to document and communicate design decisions." 

I loved this open approach to the company's rebrand. It spoke to our class discussions about open-access, and all there is to gain from sharing our work early. Discussions about the typeface and legibility for people with dyslexia arose, and Ratliff's reflection on her own doubts, worries, and position on the rebrand process provided a compelling case itself. That "there is a great deal of diversity in neurodiversity" means that one solution will never work for everyone, but there is a lot that can be done to make media malleable for adaptive technologies and different needs.

A common theme among other readings was the suggestion that accessibility is only important for people with disabilities or limitations. To find a source or technology inaccessible is a universal problem, with myriad solutions. George Williams' definition of accessibility is particularly useful:

"Accessibility exists when a user (who may or may not have a particular disability) can easily make use of a particular digital resource (which may be textual, auditory, visual, or some combination) with their choice of technology (which may or may not be explicitly labeled “assistive” technology) and can, as a result, cognitively process the information as it comes to them from that resource through that technology."

Examples of "artifacts" showcased the possibilities in audio/visual descriptions, and the crowd-sourcing potential there. Excited to discuss this topic further in class, and reflect here later!
