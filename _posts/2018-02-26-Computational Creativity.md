Kate Compton's piece on "The Casual Creator" got me thinking of the little creative projects I love, and the gendered dimensions of casual computer games I used to play. In defining creativity, Compton draws attention to how much of the line between creativity and productivity is blurred when thinking about generative games. I was interested to learn that most creativity research is funded by the military to increase their capacity to generate results! In any event, she defines the casual creator as privileging "enjoyment of the creative process above productivity," and considers the societal valuing of creativity and in whom/what ways. Casual creator software, Compton writes, enables users to take ownership of and feel pride about the things they produce. I was interested to consider how those results shape future software and how to trace those evolutions, given that they are individually generated. Where is the archive of casual creators? Or are they intrinsically ephemeral in nature? 

I also loved exploring Tracery, Twine and Inform as potential new tools for storytelling and creating digitally. I hadn't realized that Twine enabled the creation of a website to easily tell a story and have users or visitors to the site choose-their-own-adventures. In comparing Twine with Inform, a parser-based tool, in which players have to enter commands, there is the problem of a struggle guessing or achieving the correct command to move forward in the story. Especially when it is a simple story and there are not many potential outcomes with different commands, Inform might be a frustrating tool for users to interact with. While I was really interested in how Twine and Inform work and what they might yield as teaching tools, I struggled to imagine how I'd use them myself. Perhaps for troubleshooting a choose-your-own-adventure conversation in an ARIS game? Maybe digital storytelling is something I need to play with more. 

Clicking around The Heritage Jam submissions was very inspiring, especially in seeing the many different projects at different stages (including layered paper art) with relevance to digital humanities. Examples like the **Old Bones Daily** project, by Shawn Graham and Kate Ellenberger really helped me envision what Tracery is capable of, and got me excited to play with the format and plug other sources into the open-source code. What I'm always impressed with in the digital humanities readings we do is the accessibility of sources, code, and paradata if someone wants to recreate a project for themselves. It's a welcoming discipline, and the realm of digital storytelling is no less inviting!
