Considering the crowd in DH has been enlightening and worrying. Especially lately, with such an emphasis on the negatives that crowds bring, it's easy to dismiss them. My own public history discussions about collaborating with our work's publics - on "sharing authority" vs. "surrendering authority" and the implications of both - are certainly relevant to this week's topic. 

A big theme for me was that it feels like a different world and a different discussion since the revelations about targeted ads and dividing crowds in 2016 and 2017 have occurred. Some of what the authors discuss re: crowds, targeted ads, communities demand fundamental consideration of the processes through which digital media became this way, and that is still to come. 

In the authors' discussions of Wikipedia, the inescapable fact that the content is shaped by the crowd's interests, and abilities was striking. Investigating potential solutions to the inevitable biases and errors that occur when this is the case were particularly interesting. Encouraging scholars engage more with digital forums of knowledge creation like Wikipedia was a popular suggestion, and in practice, I think, requires hands-on training and more formal expectations of scholars. Edit-a-thon events, courses on the dissemination of knowledge/work through different media seem like really good things to incorporate into formal education, in keeping with discussions about the responsibilities accompanying digital humanists. 

Looking forward to talking these issues through more in class, and reflecting later!
