## Visualization

Visualization was a less novel (and less destabilizing/challenging/worrying) topic this week, and had me excited! A few disjointed thoughts I had while reading: 

- Where and how do visualization practices link up with accessibility issues? In Jefferson Bailey's piece introducing visualization, he writes that "visualization principles: proximity (positioning related movements close to each other), color (highlighting external influences), size (increasing type size for historical relevance), and connectedness and directionality (indicating paths of influence)." For many people, differentiating colours is an problem - especially nuanced colours side-by-side. How can a text-to-voice technology, for those with greater visual impairments, be best programmed to capture the essence of a graphic? Looking forward to discussing this further. 

- Davis also discussed the foundations of data visualization, and the Enlightenment value of sight/seeing. In sensory history, scholars question the hierarchies of the senses in different cultures/contexts, and the gender and class implications that those hierarchies bring. 

- Throughout the readings in DIGH 5000 so far, I've been struck with the generosity of thinking and sharing of information, sources, processes as a way of operating! __Robots Reading Vogue__ shared code and thought processes in a way that has the capacity to build knowledge! 

- On breaking things: I wrote in response to Kevin Ferguson's __Digital Surrealism__ piece, "I feel like this really speaks to what "anti-DH" scholars resist in the field - to "break" things and not know how they might be fixed is destabilizing! Perhaps it also feels like sacrilege to take a source apart in an entirely different way from that which its author intended when they put the thing into the world. Love the choice to use "heretical" here." 

Overall, visualization emphasized the illustration of a story, which I found especially wonderful. Graphics carry and create semiotic implications and speak for themselves, before text or context can be introduced to enrich them.

More after class!
